I am Juno Nam, a first year PhD student in [MIT DMSE](https://dmse.mit.edu) & [CCSE](https://cse.mit.edu), advised by Prof. [Rafael GÃ³mez-Bombarelli](http://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu).
I work on **dynamics-aware materials design**, using molecular dynamics, free energy methods, and generative models.
I am trying to do enhanced sampling with myself on the landscape of computational materials research!
