I am a third-year PhD student in MIT DMSE & CCSE, advised by Prof. Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli. I am also a research scientist intern on the FAIR Chemistry team at Meta.

I study how atoms move and rest, striving to turn their patterns into things built to last. Technically, I work on ML interatomic potentials, free energy methods, and generative modeling to understand and design molecules and materials.
